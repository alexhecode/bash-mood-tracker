# Mood Tracker

This is a mood tracker that appends your input to a text file and my FIRST bash script ðŸŽ‰!

As of now, the text file's location is set to the terminal's $HOME directory.

The six options are based on Ekman's facial-expression research examined six basic emotions: **anger**, **disgust**, **fear**, **happiness**, **sadness** and **surprise**.
